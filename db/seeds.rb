# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# r1 = UsrRole.create(role_name: "Shop adminitrator", description: "test 01")

# r3 = UsrRole.create(role_name: "Cashier", description: "test 03")
# r4 = UsrRole.create(role_name: "Price Changer", description: "test 04")
